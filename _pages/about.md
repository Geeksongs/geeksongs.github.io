I am a Master's student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), and I am honored to conduct research under the guidance of [Dr. Junfeng Yang](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/) at Columbia Software System Lab and working closely with [Lehan Yang](https://bio.lehanyang.info/) at the University of Virginia. My research interests lie in the intersection of Multimodal Large Models, AI for Science, Robotics, and Neuroscience. Additionally, I have gained valuable industry experience as an algorithm engineer intern at both [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) and [JD.com](https://www.jd.com/), where I contributed to optimizing recommendation systems and improving machine learning models.
