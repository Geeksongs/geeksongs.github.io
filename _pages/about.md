I am a Master's student at Columbia University, currently conducting research under the guidance of Dr. Junfeng Yang at Columbia and Dr. Hans Yang at the University of Virginia. My research interests lie in the intersection of multimodal large models, reinforcement learning, robotics, and neuroscience. Additionally, I have gained valuable industry experience as an algorithm engineer intern at both TikTok and JD.com, where I contributed to optimizing recommendation systems and improving machine learning models.
